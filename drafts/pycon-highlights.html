    <p>I was fortunate enough to attend PyCon 2022 this year. This is the annual Python conference, hosted by the Python Software Foundation. It was my first time going and I had few expectations going into it. I really enjoyed my time, and learned a number of new things and ways of&nbsp;thinking.</p>

            <td><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0636/" target="_new">Pattern matching</a> (new <code>match</code> keyword) seems like a neat new feature in Python 3.11. Not sure yet how I&#8217;d leverage it but I&#8217;m happy to know it will exist. It may look like a switch statement, but it&#8217;s not! It&#8217;s for flow control and unpacking variables. It&#8217;s more powerful and flexible than a switch statement, but also serves a slightly different purpose.</td>

                <blockquote>A descriptor is what we call any object that defines `__get__()`, `__set__()`, or `__delete__()` &#8230; The main motivation for descriptors is to provide a hook allowing objects stored in class variables to control what happens during attribute lookup.</blockquote>

            <td>This talk proposed hosting your Jupyter-based data science and research projects in Docker images. I&#8217;d thought of running scripts in containers, but this was specifically about running notebooks. The speaker introduced <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks" target="_new">docker-stacks</a>. I thought this was all very fascinating for creating reproducible research. However, I tried to quickly implement this with my own work and it wasn&#8217;t so easy. I still find Docker tricky as soon as you want to do even the slightest customizations to the image and runtime. Also, Conda overcomes many barriers to reproducibility and Docker seems to only contribute marginally.</td>

            <td>This was an exposition of a data science project. The speaker basically linked up some <span class="caps">CO2</span> and climate sensors to a microcontroller and slapped a prediction algorithm on top. A couple learnings. First, open the windows, get some air inside your room/office! Second, machine learning projects don&#8217;t have to be crazy complex. You can get detailed, but it&#8217;s not necessary to make a point. The most interesting projects are the ones with real world consequences, not just the titanic dataset or housing prices. Third, so much effort goes into everything that sets up any prediction model. Always remember that.</td>

Dr. Issaoun&#8217;s talk was an inspiration, and for an extremely complex subject (astrophysics, astronomy, blackholes, etc.) she made the audience (or at least me) feel like experts and curious children simultaneously. If I had to pick one talk to re-attend, this would be the one. It was the only one where I went up to talk to the speaker at the end.</td>

I don&#8217;t know exactly how I would use Python-in-the-browser but I can imagine it will open a world of possibilities, similar to Node. I&#8217;m very eager to see where this project goes, and perhaps sometime soon I&#8217;ll give it a try and write up my experience.</td>

For example, it might be necessary to create a blocklist of packages that can&#8217;t be imported; or load package code from a remote database. In both cases, it can be helpful to modify and overload the default package search and execution process. I currently have no use case for it, but it was good to learn about what&#8217;s happening under the hood. I had never considered the process with which Python resolves and loads the modules we import.</td>

It seems like it could help solve a number of common data science and machine learning problems. I just need to learn it. I&#8217;ve decided to try it out in a current project I&#8217;m working on. There is a learning curve, but not near as bad as something like Docker; more comparable to git. So far I&#8217;m finding a little value in the experiment tracking functionality. I don&#8217;t really want to implement my own visualizations to <a href="https://dvc.org/doc/use-cases/experiment-tracking" traget="_new">track experiments</a>, as was proposed in this talk, and I&#8217;m hoping the maintainers of the <span class="caps">DVC</span> library add in more viz tools.</td>
