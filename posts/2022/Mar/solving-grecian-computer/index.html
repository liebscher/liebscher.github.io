    <p>My family celebrated my grandma&#8217;s 88th birthday a couple weekends ago. She, however, was prepared to give out gifts to everyone else. Knowing what my family enjoys doing, she mail ordered (from a catalogue, yes) a puzzle for us all to solve. It&#8217;s called the Grecian Computer puzzle. Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t find any reliable background on it. Barnes and Noble <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/true-genius-greek-computer-2-wooden-brainteaser-puzzle-project-genius/1137585230">claims</a> it was inspired by an astronomical tool found in an old Grecian shipwreck. I think it&#8217;s just a puzzle someone came up with. However skeptical I am of its origins, the puzzle is hard, very hard. My sister, dad, and I took turns trying to solve it and none of us made any progress. Not that we&#8217;re numerical geniuses, but collectively we were&nbsp;stumped.</p>
<p>To help you picture what we were up against, here is what the puzzle looks&nbsp;like:</p>
<p><img data-src="/images/grecian-computer-start.jpg" class="uk-align-center" width="90%" height="" alt="Starting position of the Grecian Computer puzzle" uk-img></p>
<p>Each of the concentric circles rotates, and the goal is to turn these dials until each of the 12 columns add up to&nbsp;42.</p>
<p>The dials aren&#8217;t purely concentric &#8212; some of the spaces are &#8220;blank&#8221;, revealing the number on the dial&nbsp;below.</p>
<p>After turning the dials for a while without success, I took out a piece of paper and started writing out numbers. It took me a moment before realizing how to write them out: each dial being a &#8220;layer&#8221; and represented as a matrix. I could leave a cell empty to represent a hole in a dial. Here&#8217;s one of my&nbsp;notes:</p>
<p><img data-src="/images/grecian-computer-notes.jpg" class="uk-align-center" width="60%" height="" alt="A piece of scratch paper with a collection of numbers written out to describe my thoughts while trying to represent the puzzle numerically" uk-img></p>
<p>This started to make sense in my head and I noticed a couple patterns, but nothing meaningful enough to help solve the puzzle. I thought, Well since these are really just matrices, could we write an algorithm to solve&nbsp;this?</p>
<p>Let me first get it out of the way that yes, I solved the puzzle. Yes, I did it using a computer. No, I have no idea how to solve the puzzle without the computer&#8217;s brute force. Puzzles are for meant to be fun, and reveling in Algorithm Land is my version of&nbsp;fun.</p>
<p>That made clear, I&#8217;m sure the reader is most interested in the computational solution. Without further delay, I first will describe the solution, then my progress and&nbsp;learnings.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>I represented our puzzle as a 3-dimensional tensor. A tensor is a generalization of a scalar, a vector, or a matrix. A scalar is a 0-dimensional tensor, a vector 1-dimensional, and a matrix 2-dimensional. The puzzle has 5 dials, with 4 rows of numbers, and 12 columns. Naturally then, this is a tensor with shape&nbsp;5x4x12.</p>
<p>The solution is given to us: all columns must sum to 42. Mathematically, we can represent this solution as a vector of length 12, each value equal to&nbsp;42.</p>
<p>We have two unanswered questions. First, how do we represent those &#8220;blank&#8221; or &#8220;empty&#8221; cells? Second, how do we &#8220;rotate&#8221; the&nbsp;dials?</p>
<p>My answer to the first is that the &#8220;empty&#8221; cells in the tensor are set to 0. A zero signals, through masking and multiplication, that the value beneath is&nbsp;used.</p>
<p>My answer to the second is to &#8220;rotate&#8221; or &#8220;roll&#8221; a specific axis of the tensor. The matrix gets pushed to the right and the column that falls off gets placed on the&nbsp;left.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m intentionally grounding this explanation in metaphors of the physical world. Without the metaphors, we would quickly become lost in&nbsp;terminology.</p>
<p>Another hidden difficulty in this is summing the columns. What&#8217;s trivial for the human eye to pick up as a &#8220;column&#8221; is less so in this computational framework. I thought of this as working down, or outward. First, we consider the innermost or top dial. Suppose on a dial, <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, with two numbers (but four spaces) there&nbsp;are</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>[0, 5, 0, 1]
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then if we sum over each column we get the result: <code>[0, 5, 0, 1]</code>.</p>
<p>Suppose there&#8217;s a dial underneath, call this <span class="math">\(B\)</span>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>[
  [1,1,1,1],
  [2,2,2,2]
]
</code></pre></div>

<p>How would we add this with the innermost dial? Overlay the first dial onto the second. The first column would be 1 + 2 = 3. Second, 1 + 5 = 6. Third, 1 + 2 = 3. Fourth, 1 + 1 = 2. Resulting in <code>[3, 6, 3, 2]</code>.</p>
<p>I represented the innermost dial <span class="math">\(A\)</span> then&nbsp;as</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>[
  [0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 5, 0, 1]
]
</code></pre></div>

<p>To quickly compute the result of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> overlaid on <span class="math">\(B\)</span>,&nbsp;solve:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>A + (A == 0)*B
</code></pre></div>

<p>where <code>(A == 0)</code> becomes a masking matrix of 1s (<code>True</code>) and 0s (<code>False</code>). Thus this only uses values of <span class="math">\(B\)</span> where <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is empty. Bringing it all together, this sums the values of <span class="math">\(B\)</span> where <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is empty, with all values of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p>We extend this for all five puzzle dials until we have something that looks&nbsp;like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sum</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">game</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">+</span>

    <span class="n">axis</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Here <code>game</code> is just a copy of the game board after rotating it. Consider <code>game[4]</code> as <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <code>game[3]</code> as <span class="math">\(B\)</span>. Now extend the logic to the next dial, say <span class="math">\(C\)</span>, where the values of <span class="math">\(C\)</span> are only relevant where we can see them (i.e. where the values of both <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> are&nbsp;0).</p>
<p>Now what about rotating the dials? Numpy has an <code>np.roll</code> method that performs exactly what we need: rolling an axis of a tensor so that the &#8220;columns&#8221; are shifted, with the final column being carried over to the&nbsp;front.</p>
<p>Lastly, we must represent the state of the dial somehow. I did this with a vector of length 5, with each element representing the rotation (up to 12) of one of the five dials. The starting point of the game is arbitrary, and doesn&#8217;t matter since we can brute force all combinations&nbsp;anyways.</p>
<p>We have a function for summing the puzzle and checking the&nbsp;score:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">equals</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">layers</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="c1"># now sum all the columns, for each dial taking into account how it&#39;s masked</span>

<p>It took 10,871 dial turns to reach the solution: [0, 5, 9, 2,&nbsp;7].</p>
<p>Here is what the puzzle looks like at this state, with all columns adding to&nbsp;42:</p>

<h2>Progress and&nbsp;Learnings</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m glad to be able to share this solution, and I did my best to explain it simply. There was a handful of attempts to get here though, and it wasn&#8217;t a straight&nbsp;shot.</p>
<p>First, I didn&#8217;t immediately realize that I&#8217;d need to mask numbers. I was confused why the columns weren&#8217;t adding up digitally like they were on the puzzle. Eventually I understood that numbers on outer dials were being &#8220;hidden&#8221; by inner dials. I found that I could mask the outer dials by converting the inner dial to &#8220;mask&#8221; or &#8220;no&nbsp;mask&#8221;.</p>
<p>I also wasn&#8217;t aware of the <code>np.roll</code> method going into this. I thought I was going to have to&#8230; roll my own. Luckily, it took me one or two Google searches to find the pre-built roll method. It did however take me some time to understand how best to use it in this case. Through trial-and-error, I rolled different tensors and tried matching the output with what I&nbsp;expected.</p>
<p>It was about this point that a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion">recursive strategy</a> came to mind. I prototyped a looping method, but it seemed too &#8220;hardcoded&#8221;, messy, and &#8220;stateful.&#8221; I have not taken any algorithms courses though. My understanding of algorithms, and recursion, is very&nbsp;limited.</p>
<p>I also realized around this time that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to continue on without using simplified toy data. The real data was too complex, and if I wanted to prototype with only one or two layers I wouldn&#8217;t have a known solution. So, I created a toy dataset of size 3x3x3 (3 dials, with 3 rows, and 3&nbsp;columns).</p>
<p>I came up with a first recursive attempt, but, surprisingly, it wasn&#8217;t recursive enough. I was really only iterating down a single dimension, not all dimensions. So, many of the possible combinations weren&#8217;t getting tried out. I paused and thought about what I needed in a recursive function. I tried&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>There were a couple updates to adapt my previous recursive function to the real data. The toy data was necessary for getting the mechanics down, but I needed to see how things would flow in reality. This included putting quite a few print statements in the recursive&nbsp;function.</p>
<p>As I was testing, I hit a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2401447/python-recursive-function-error-maximum-recursion-depth-exceeded">RecursionError</a> saying I reached the maximum recursion depth. I had to Google what this meant. I went back to the drawing board to start fresh with some of the implementations I saw&nbsp;online.</p>
<p>I created a new function and again hit a recursion error. This forced me to go learn about <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33923/what-is-tail-recursion">(non-)tail recursion</a> and how Python handles this type of computation. I discovered that Guido in fact <a href="https://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2009/04/tail-recursion-elimination.html">does not believe</a> that Python should be designed with recursion in&nbsp;mind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Third, I don&#8217;t believe in recursion as the basis of all programming. This is a fundamental belief of certain computer scientists, especially those who love Scheme and like to teach programming by starting with a &#8220;cons&#8221; cell and recursion. But to me, seeing recursion as the basis of everything else is just a nice theoretical approach to fundamental mathematics (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down">turtles all the way down</a>), not a day-to-day&nbsp;tool.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So trying to use recursion had come back to bite me. I read that Python only allowed at most about 1000 levels deep in a recursive function. After this, the memory stack has too much to keep track of, and opts to fail. Next time I think I will favor an iterative approach, at least when using&nbsp;Python.</p>
<p>I found a snippet of code on <a href="https://chrispenner.ca/posts/python-tail-recursion">a kind person&#8217;s blog</a> which catches any tail recursion error, if there is one. If it catches an error, it restarts a new stack of memory after closing out the original function. This allows the recursive function to continue on even if it hits Python&#8217;s recursive limit. In my case, this was a good enough solution to carry onward. You can see how this decorator is used in my code above. I copy here the&nbsp;snippet:</p>

<p>Eventually, I hit run and the function carried out for about 5 to 10 seconds. As I mentioned, after 10,871 iterations, the function reached an output. I determined what the board would be at that result and tested it out on the game in my hand.&nbsp;Success!</p>
