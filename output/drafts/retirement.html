    <p>Recently I was brought on full-time at BetterUp as a Jr. Computational Social Scientist. My timing has been spot on. Our product is growing at an astronomical pace and we&#8217;ve just recently finished a Series E round of funding. Couldn&#8217;t be more proud of where we&#8217;re&nbsp;at.</p>
<p>Although this is all new, I&#8217;m also discovering a new world of things. Part of this has been a real salary and benefits. New hires have to make a decision about retirement planning as well. The decision which has boggled my mind since our first week of onboarding has been: do I contribute to the traditional 401(k) the company offers, or their Roth 401(k), or&nbsp;both?</p>
<p>I like the idea of saving my money while I&#8217;m young so compound interest can work its magic, so I&#8217;ve decided that I must contribute <em>something</em>. But which one will give me the biggest bang for my buck in 30&nbsp;years?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, young people are put into the workforce before anyone ever teaches them about taxes, retirement, and saving. Here I&#8217;m going to break down my decision to contribute fully to a traditional 401(k) here, although I&#8217;m not licensed to talk about this nor am I an expert. Just a young professional trying to make a&nbsp;decision.</p>
<p>I had to do the math myself, so I made a spreadsheet (find on Google Sheets&nbsp;here).</p>
<p>I make some assumptions before starting though, including: 1) my income is $X and won’t increase ever, 2) federal taxes only, 3) 6.00% constant annual interest rate on investments, 4) single and no dependents for life, 5) no inflation, 6) all 2021 tax rates, and 7) marginal tax rate at retirement of 15%. Crazy assumptions but it&#8217;s the best I can do right&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to illustrate my decision, but I don&#8217;t know how I feel about sharing my exact salary. For the sake of the example, let&#8217;s say we&#8217;re dealing with an income of $110,000 per&nbsp;year.</p>
<p>First, for the traditional: <span class="math">\(110,000 in income, and let’s say we basically max out the 401k contributions at \\)</span>18,000 per year. With the 2021 standard deduction and pre-tax contributions, my taxable income would be \<span class="math">\(89,450. Therefore, the actual paid taxes would be \\)</span>15,489. Post-tax income is the difference which is \<span class="math">\(73,961. I can continue to contribute $18,000 per year for the remaining 41 years: that’s $1,500 / month at 6% interest for 41 years, or $3,189,985.63 saved. After withdrawals at 15% retirement tax rate, which would be ~\)</span>478,500 in taxes, I’d be left with&nbsp;$2,711,487.79.</p>
<p>Next, for the Roth 401k: $110,000 in income, less the standard deduction is  $97,450.00 in taxable income. That’s $17,409 in federal taxes. Post-tax contributions would be $18,000, so post-tax income is $62,041. That’s about $4,000 less than the traditional per year (so if I was concerned about having more annual income then the tradition wins right here). At 6% interest, and 41 years, and $1,500 / month contributions, I’d again have $3,189,985.63 saved. With the Roth though, no withdrawal taxes, so I’d be left with all that. This here is almost $500k more than the traditional. Additionally, I would pay about $177,000 more in taxes up front for the Roth than the traditional (19809 - 15489 = 4320 * 41 =&nbsp;177120).</p>
<p>However, the flaw in the Roth is that is assume no increase in income. Suppose instead that I meet the $140k income limit for only the next 10 years. I’d be able to contribute the $18k/yr to the Roth 401k for those 10 years, but I would then be unable to contribute to the account (since I reached the max income). So for 10 years at 6% interest and $1,500/month, I’d accumulate $245,819.02. Then this amount would just sit as principal without contributions for the remaining 31 years. At 6% interest, that’s $1,571,775.29. This is $1.2m less than the traditional 401k in 41&nbsp;years.</p>
<p>So the gist of it: the Roth 401k would cost about $177k more up front in taxes, but ultimately be worth about $500k more than the traditional. This is assuming I’d be under the $140k income limit for the next 41 years though, which doesn&#8217;t represent where I see myself, and so accounting for that, the traditional far out&nbsp;performs.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my naive understanding of taxes, appreciation, and investing. It&#8217;s enough of a justification for a decision now, and hopefully I won&#8217;t regret it too much in the future. The bottom line though is that contributing to any compounding interest account is better than not, so this all might just be fluff. Even if that though, I&#8217;ve learned a bit about income taxes, retirement, and&nbsp;investing.</p>
