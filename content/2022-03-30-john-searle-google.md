Talk about two things:
1. Celebrate the significance of technological advances
2. Discuss the many things that matter about the understanding of technology

Must make a couple distinctions

In Western culture, there's emphasis on objectivity and subjectivity

Strive for objective science, but these terms are ambiguous.

Ambiguous between epistemic (haing to do with knowledge) and ontological (having to do with existence)

Epistemically, the distinction is between types of knowledge claims

> Rembrandt born in 1606 (obj) v. Rembrant is the greatest painter who ever lives (subj)

Underlying this is also a difference in modes of existence. Some things exist no matter what anyone thinks (mountains, molecules, etc). These are ontologically *objective*. But other things, such as pain, pleasure, and tickles exist only as expereicned by a subject. These are ontologically *subjective*. Many phenomena that are ontologically subjective can still be looked at as epistemically objective. 

Science is epistemically objective, but just because we want to study things scientifically (under an epistemically objective lense), does not mean we cannot study ontologically subjective matters. For example, neuroscientists might say they cannot study consciousness because that's not science. However, this is only due to the ambiguity in existing terms: a neuroscientist surely coudl study consciousness through epistemic objectivity even though it is ontologically subjective (it exists only from the perspective of the agent).

Another distinction: between phenom are observer independent (mountains, etc., exists regardless) and observer relative (money, etc., exists only to users and people). Latter about attitudes toward something.

All observer relative pheon are created by human consciousness, thus contain some ontological subjectivity. But we can have an epistemically objective science of a domain that is observer relative.

We can have an objective study of econmomics even though it's observer relative and contains ontologically subjectivity.

Many subjects in cog sci have references that are observer relative not indpendent.
