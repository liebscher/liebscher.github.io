what might make a good turn model?

taking in just tokens, timestamps, and speakers (i.e. an AWS transcript), how can we quickly put together a good transcript? what are some things to think about (e.g. back-channels)? what's a way to measure the accuracy of a model if we don't have labeled data?

what sorts of biases are likely to show up bc of a turn model?
