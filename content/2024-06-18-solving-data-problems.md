I came to a realization lately. That realization starts when I was perhaps in 4th or 5th grade. I loved playing with LEGOS at the time. Building things up and tearing them down and making whatever my imagination could come up with. But there were two inventions that I thought repeatedly and deeply about, racking my brain. The first was the concept of an ATM machine, and the second was a car's transmission. I nearly obsessed over teh idea of building these from LEGOs. In middle school, I took a computer media class and learned to program with Adobe Flash. I become enraptured with the idea of designing my own game, especially one that mimicked what I saw in online games like Club Penguin. I wanted to deconstruct Club Penguin, and create my own world. Those coding skills evolved into a passion for web development. How could design something so beautiful with just code? When I got to college, through my interests in people, programming, and the arts I discovered cognitive science. There was something so tantalizing about the human brain, and how sensory inputs eventually became behaviors and thoughts. Obviously this is very B.F. Skinner Behaviorist, and I know that's out of fashion, but for an undereducated mind this input-output relationship was intriguing. I also discovered machine learning, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing. In the middle of my college education I dove deep on some of these models and really became familiar with the idea of a "black box." In fact, I became obsessed with this concept. I wanted to break the code of the black box so badly; I wanted to peer inside, to understand it, to break it down and be able to tell people what was going on inside. The tingling feeling of knowing how the magic trick was performed. I came to realize that the human mind was perhaps the blackest of boxes. Decades into psychology and neuroscience and we barely have an explanation for what's going on in there.

Looking back, these experiences are tied together by my deeply rooted interest in being able to break down a complex system, understand its inner workings, and explain it to others.

One of the tasks or projects that has captivated me for the last five years has been the job of explaining data. Really what this means though is understanding that somewhere there is an output, and somewhere there is an input. Thankfully, someone (possibly me) has written down, or recorded, a representation of these ins and outs. Now the job that has so captivated me is understanding the relationship between input and output. If I can understand that relationship, I can say meaningful things, valuable and useful things, about either the input or the output; and I can try to predict the output if I have a new input. I've realized that this is an extremely important role to play in this world.

Why? Because there are more inputs and outputs than we can count, and a huge number of these relationships people actually really care about. It turns out that it means a lot if you can explain how money comes out of an ATM machine, or how power is transformed by a transmission, or how images are generated through text.

Yet, understanding them is not enough. That is merely the beginning. One must understand in order to extend.

If someone has, or I have, a problem where I know the input and I know the output of a system, I will be motivated and interested in figuring out that relationship. However, if I can understand and explain the relationship, I can predict too. I can also suggest new questions, or new hypotheses. I can drive what happens next for that relationship. I can perturb it.

Many people don't care about figuring out relationships, or describing systems. They will never know how the magic trick is performed. For many, that's fine. Just enjoy the show, no need to scrutinize the magician. I'm discovering though that my job is to scrutizine the magician through curiosity, write down how the trick is performed, and help the magician improve their trick (or, tell others how the trick is done, if that's what everyone wants).

Why am I a scientist? A scientist's job is to bring us closer and closer to the truth of the world. That means understanding how the many systems that comprise the world function. 

What to do with this realization?

Moving forward, I want to be more cognizant of the systems in which I'm working. What exactly am I trying to explain? What web is being disentangled? What are the inputs and outputs, and what do others think is going on between them? My latest north star then is to seek out problems where a relationship is in need of being illuminated.

What about where the problem is not known yet? Perhaps that will require me to see an output, and consequently wonder about the input and the complex system, the black box, lying between the two. What phenonemon do I see, experience, know and why are they occuring?

Ah, asking why. I've always been good at asking a why question...
